            <h2>It's Time to Move On: A Manifesto for a Post-Email World</h2>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <h3>Preamble</h3>
            <p>We built email decades ago for a different era — and it shows. What once felt revolutionary now drags us down. Every day, we dig through inboxes bloated with noise, chasing threads, patching holes in privacy, and losing time we can’t afford to waste. It’s not just inefficient — it’s broken. We’re carrying the weight of a legacy system into a world that’s outgrown it.</p>
            <p>We’ve moved on in every other way. Our devices are smarter. Our apps are faster. But our communication? It’s still stuck in the 1990s. It’s time to stop fixing email and start replacing it.</p>

            <h3>The Problem: Everything’s a Blob</h3>
            <p>Email treats everything — a meeting request, a grocery list, a contract, a spam ad — as the same thing: a wall of unstructured text. It puts the burden on us to make sense of it all. We flag, forward, CC, dig, archive, and hope we didn’t miss something important. That kind of mental overhead adds up. And it's no way to work, collaborate, or live.</p>

            <h3>The Vision: Communication with Context</h3>
            <p>We need something fundamentally different — something built for how we actually work and interact today.</p>
            <p>We call it Clarion. It’s not just a new app. It’s a new protocol — a shared language for communication that understands structure, intent, and identity.</p>
            <p>Clarion is built around three principles:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Structured by design:</strong> A task is a task. A note is a note. Each interaction has a purpose and a state. No more subject-line gymnastics.</li>
                <li><strong>You own your identity:</strong> Built on decentralized identifiers, your Clarion ID belongs to you. Not rented from Google. Not spoofed by phishing. Truly yours.</li>
                <li><strong>Private by default:</strong> Every message is end-to-end encrypted. No backdoors. No leaks. Just communication that stays between the people involved.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>The Solution: The Clarion Protocol</h3>
            <p>Clarion isn’t one app or platform. It’s an open, federated protocol — like email once was, but modern and built to last.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Typed Messages:</strong> Instead of typing into a blank box, you send a Task, Note, Canvas, Thread, or Query — each with its own flow. Your inbox becomes more like a command center than a junk drawer.</li>
                <li><strong>Federated Network:</strong> Anyone can run a Clarion server. No central gatekeeper. Just like with email, but without the baggage.</li>
                <li><strong>Bridge to Email:</strong> A built-in bridge lets you connect with the old world while stepping into the new. You don’t have to cut ties — just start building forward.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Call to Action</h3>
            <p>Clarion won’t be built by one company or team. It has to be bigger than that. This is a call to builders, designers, developers, cryptographers, and dreamers. If you believe communication should be smarter, safer, and more intentional — come help shape what comes next.</p>
            <p>Let’s stop rehashing email. Let’s build the thing that replaces it.</p>

                <p>The future isn’t just messages.</p>
                <p>It’s structure.</p>
                <p>It’s privacy.</p>
                <p>It’s clarity.</p>
                <p>It’s Clarion.</p>
